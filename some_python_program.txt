# NOTE: We did not cover Lambda functins in class. A Lambda Function 
# in Python programming is an anonymous function
# or a function having no name. It is a small and restricted function 
# having no more than one line. In the case below, the Lambda function code
# is calling the code/function button_click() with the numbers 0-9 as the 
# parameter. Just like a normal function, a Lambda function can have multiple
# arguments with one expression. 

button_1 =  Button(root, text="1", padx=40, pady=20, command=lambda: button_click(1))  
# creates the button for number 1 and associate it with the button_click function
# button_1 will display the number "1" on the calculator and call button_click(1) when pressed.

button_2 =  Button(root, text="2", padx=40, pady=20, command=lambda: button_click(2))  
# create the button for the number 2 and associate it with the button_click function 
# button_2 will display the number "2" and call button_click(2) when pressed

button_3 =  Button(root, text="3", padx=40, pady=20, command=lambda: button_click(3)) 
# create the button for the number 3 and associate it with the button_click function
# button_3 will display the number "3" and call button_click(3) when pressed

button_4 =  Button(root, text="4", padx=40, pady=20, command=lambda: button_click(4))
