# M9_Team_Act

This program is a simple calculator created using Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator has buttons for numbers and operators, and the result is displayed in a text field.

Users can click on the buttons to input numbers and select operations, with a "Clear" button to reset the input and an "Equal" button to show the result. The program uses a grid layout to position the buttons and keeps the window open with an event loop for user interaction.
